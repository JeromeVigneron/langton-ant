Foreword
--------
The Langton's ant is Universal Turing machine, a simulation of a specific Turing machine. A Turing machine, named "a-machine" before, was an invention of Alan TURING (1912-1954). It's a theoretical model that allow to generate symbols at the output of a computing process, based on a mathematical function and a chosen input (mathematical model of computing). The symbols follows typical patterns which are more and less specified in the mathematical model.
